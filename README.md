We need a few libraries installed for the dashboard to render. We have identified the below set, which could vary with your local python installation. The general format for any module error encountered will be 
pip install <module_name>

pip install dash

pip install dash_renderer

pip install pandas

pip install pandas_datareader

pip install loremipsum

pip install coinmarketcap

pip install dash_core_components

pip install dash_html_components

pip install quandl

After the above installations run setup.py

After setup.py is run successfully(takes some time to train classifier) run launchDashboard.py
